## Lab #1

Based on the data given, the company wants to enahnce their business using the data that it already has. 

A mixed team was created to find a solution and this team elected a possible solution with low-budget: run an internal survey across all the internal people, but the limited budget forces to not spread a proper knowledge over the data ( customer, product, etc. ), so the Engineering people wants to create an AI Assistant (ChatBot) that allows the people to ask about the previous data and run the survey without compromise the results for the Business department.
